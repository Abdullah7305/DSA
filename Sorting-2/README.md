Merge Sort:
    the idea for this algorithm, is to break the array in to smalled peices and then we will try to merge the array.
    First with the help of recusrion we will break all the elemnt of the array until the size of the last invokder function's array is 1.
    We will then try to merge the array using the merg function there by simply comparing the value of the array at right and left and then using the tempo array we save them ar the sorted value and then we will replace them by the original array

Quick Sort:
    Here we tr to do recursion again but this time we have another approach that help us to save the space so NO O(n) comes we try to do the partition there be finding the pivot there and then placing the smaller value to the left while the larger value to the right
