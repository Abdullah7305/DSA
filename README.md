Selection sort:
    Here we try to take out the smalled value from the array by traversing from i+1 to the n and replace it with the value at index i
    Then we move the i and the iteration proceed and the left side of the i become sorted as i move forward

Insertion Sort:
    Here we try to use the while loop in the inner loop and we move the j inside only if the alue of j is bigger then 0 and arr[j-1]>arr[j] then we make the swap this cause the y pair choice

Bubble Sort:
    Here we try to shift the biggest number at the end of the array and it is done by swapping the pair and causing the biggest one to go the end i=n-1 and j will come from 0 to <= i-1 and we will move and swap if arr[j]>arr[j+1] then will swapped
